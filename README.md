- 👋 Hi, I’m my name is Ramon or @ramf13 (if you want to go by my GitHub handle)
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code. I am a Product Marketer for Azure and would love to get an even deeper look into coding and what devs do with the products I am marketing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all of the wonderful products and apps in Azure's portfolio, but most importantly cloud native and hybrid ones.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on just learning. If you can give me tips on how to learn how to code and/or how you use Azure, that would be AWESOME!
- 📫 Reach out to me via LinkedIn @ https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramonluis13/ :)
